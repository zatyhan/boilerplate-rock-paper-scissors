# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a personal project built on the freecodecamp's boilerplate for the Rock Paper Scissors project. I've added my own custom algorithm for RPS to battle agaisnt four bots as provided in the boilerplate. 

This algorithm is created based on the Markovian chain idea, except that it does not calculate the probability but rather the number of observations only to decide on the next state based on the previous state. The test_module tests my algorithm against the four bots and successfully achieved >61% winning rate respectively which is the minimum requirement to pass freecodecamp's project.
